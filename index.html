    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Elm sits at the intersection of web development and academic research on functional programming languages. It has a strong focus on bridging this divide by sharing experience and knowledge between these two very different communities. <strong>This communication is hugely valuable to the overall programming community!</strong> For example, Elm has already influenced architecture in React (through Redux and others) and error message quality in Rust.</p>
